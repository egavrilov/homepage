  <h1>Hello.</h1>
  <p>
    Before should be introduced as a Frontend Developer with 6 years experience
    there are few things to say. Assigned the title of a Developer since 2006 when
    successfully launched the first website of my hometown (news aggregator and
    forum board). The website was built from blocks: Website CMS <em>«PHP-Fusion»</em>,
    forum software <em>«punBB»</em>, a number of pluginsand scripts available for free use (time before GitHub was hard to search and share opensource projects). Building software from blocks was a good start to learn Development, but <strong>Engineering</strong> is a way better!

    Last 6 years I was opportinuty to work on great projects and add value to their UI and UX. Last 3 years I'm doing UI and UX expertise and see my future in e-Commerce or SASS
    Project which has a lot of possibillities of UI improvements and influence user experience by visial incentives.
