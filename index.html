  <h1>Hello.</h1>
  <small>
    Before should be introduced as a Frontend Developer with 6 years experience
    there are few things to say. Assigned the title of a Developer since 2006 when
    successfully launched the first website of my hometown (news aggregator and
    forum board). The website was built from blocks: Website CMS <em>«PHP-Fusion»</em>,
    forum software <em>«punBB»</em>, a number of plugins and scripts available for free use (time before GitHub was hard to search and share opensource projects). Building software from blocks was a good start to Develop, but <strong>Engineering</strong> is a way better!
